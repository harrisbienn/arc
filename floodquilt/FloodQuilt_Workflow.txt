1.	Existing Conditions Paths: W:\Citrix\54000s\54857\001\GIS\Ch2\Flood_Quilt_v2\Processing\Final_Existing
		Export each frequency (10, 1, 0.2) (Separate feature classes) to a working GDB on your local computer
		10-year: FLOOD_FREQ = 10 
		100-year: FLOOD_FREQ = 10 + 1  
		500-year: FLOOD_FREQ = 10 + 1 + 0.2
 
i.	Future Conditions Paths: W:\Citrix\54000s\54857\001\GIS\Ch2\Future_Quilt\Future_Clipped_By_HUCS
		Export each frequency (10, 1, 0.2) (Separate feature classes) to a working GDB on your local computer
		10-year: FLOOD_FREQ = 10 
		100-year: FLOOD_FREQ = 10 + 1  
		500-year: FLOOD_FREQ = 10 + 1 + 0.2
 
2.	For each Feature class created run Multipart to single part geoprocessing tool

3.	Use the Merge tool (Analysis > Tools > Data Management > Merge) to combine the feature classes for each frequency (example: existing10YR + future10YR).
 
4.	Once the two datasets are in one feature class, use the Dissolve tool to fully combine the two datasets together.
	o	Save the output into a Feature Dataset within your working geodatabase.

5.	For each dissolved frequency run repair geometry using validation method OGC
 
6.	Once repair geometry is complete for all three frequencies, use the Erase tool. (Requires advanced pro license)(Parallel processing 100)
	o	Erase the 100-year floodplains from the 500-year.
	o	Erase the 10-year floodplains from the 100-year.
7.  Once you have the 3 feature classes ready to be merged add a text field (FLOOD_FREQ) for each feature class, use the codes 10, 1, 0.2
	o	Multipart to singlepart, and repair geometry on each erased feature class added here
8.	Use the Merge tool to combine the files below into a single output feature class. Save output in a Feature Dataset with the Coord system NAD 1983 (2011) Texas Centric Mapping System Lambert (Meters)
	o	10-year floodplains
	o	Erased 100-year floodplains
	o	Erased 500-year floodplains
9.	Use the Create Topology (Catalog > Right-click Feature Dataset > New > Topology) on the merged feature class output in the previous step.
	o	Rules will be:
		1.	Must Not Overlap

10. Intersect w/ counties and watersheds and then dissolve by FFRQ, HUC10 and ENT NAME (single county). Clip by HUC boundary and load into FutFldHaz schema.
